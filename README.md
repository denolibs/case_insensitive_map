# case_insensitive_map

Case insensitive version of the native Map object. Extends Map.

This object works by converting string keys to their uppercase equivalents. Non-string keys remain unchanged.

# Usage

```typescript
new CaseInsensitiveMap();
```

# API

The **CaseInsensitiveMap** API is identical to the [Map API on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).
